"""TaskCompleted hook — presence + sentinel verification gate.

Exit 2 prevents the task from being marked complete unless BOTH hold:
  1. PRESENCE — the task carries a `Run: <command>` (a defined verification step), and
  2. SENTINEL — the completing teammate left a verification marker at
       ~/.claude/logs/verified/<team_name>/task-<task_id>.verified
     written AFTER its Run command passed.

Why a sentinel: the hook payload's transcript_path is the lead's session, not the
teammate's, so the hook cannot observe the teammate actually running tests. The
sentinel is the teammate's attestation. On a successful pass it is consumed
(deleted) so it cannot be reused for a later re-completion.

Teammate convention (documented in agent-team-protocol):
    mkdir -p ~/.claude/logs/verified/<team>
    echo "<Run cmd> PASSED" > ~/.claude/logs/verified/<team>/task-<id>.verified
    # then TaskUpdate(status=completed)

Bypass: token [skip-verify] in subject/description (e.g. docs-only tasks).
FAIL OPEN: any internal error allows the completion.
